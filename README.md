- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Carlos Ponte! I've been working as TSR for GCP support for almost a year (since August 2022). During this time I've been able to learn a lot about GCP and certify myself and Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Cloud administration and DevOps.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Ansible, Jenkins and each day finding new things to learn! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can reach me through the different options in my profile, but I'd specially prefer to be contacted via email.
