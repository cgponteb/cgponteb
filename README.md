- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos Ponte! I'm almost done studying to become a Higher Technician in Computer Network Systems Management. Only 3 months of Professional Training and Guidance left to get my title, which I'll be achieving in December 2022.
- 👀 I’m interested in backend development and System Administration/SRE.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Django, Git, Docker and each day finding new things to learn! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to use the summer to learn as many things I can about the interests above written, and to find my first job as backend developer / system administrator when I finish the studies mentioned.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach me through the different options in my profile, but I'd specially prefer to be contacted via email.
